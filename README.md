# apac-coe-technical-test-fall-2023
This is my attempt for APAC COE Technical Test (Full-Stack).

## Package used

- fastapi: FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+ based on standard Python type hints.

- sqlalchemy: SQLAlchemy is a SQL toolkit and Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Python.

- pymysql: PyMySQL is a pure-Python MySQL client library that allows you to connect to a MySQL server and perform database operations.

- pyjwt: PyJWT is a Python library that allows you to encode and decode JSON Web Tokens (JWT).

- dash: Dash is a productive Python framework for building web applications.

- pandas: Pandas is a powerful data manipulation library for Python.

- python-dotenv: python-dotenv is a Python library that reads key-value pairs from a .env file and adds them to your environment variables.

- uvicorn: Uvicorn is a lightning-fast ASGI server implementation, using uvloop and httptools.

- httpx: HTTPX is a fully featured HTTP client for Python 3, which provides sync and async APIs, and support for both HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2.

- python-multipart: python-multipart is a Python library for parsing multipart/form-data requests. This package does not have 3k stars but it is a requirement for fastapi form-data

- flask-login: Flask-Login is a Flask extension that provides user session manag

- pytest: Pytest is a testing framework for Python that allows you to write simple and scalable tests.

- ruff: An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust.

## Getting Start Guides
To start the application, you can follow these steps:

1. Install Python: Install Python 3.12: Python 3.12 is the latest version of Python at the time of writing. To install Python 3.12 on your machine, you can follow the official Python website's installation instructions or use a package manager specific to your operating system.

1. Install Poetry: Poetry is a dependency management and packaging tool for Python. You can install it by following the instructions on the Poetry website.

1. Run the scripts: You can now use the Poetry CLI to run your scripts. For example, to start the API, you can run poetry run api. Similarly, you can run poetry run app to start the app.

1. Login to the app: `username:admin, password: secret`

## Comments on task (optional)
Great job on designing an interview task that is both fun and practical. It's refreshing to have a coding challenge that goes beyond the traditional LeetCode style and actually tests the candidate's ability to handle real-world scenarios.

I really appreciate how comprehensive the task is in terms of testing the candidate's technical skills across both frontend and backend development. It provides a great opportunity to showcase their abilities in different areas.

However, I have a slight concern about the length of the task. It can be quite challenging for applicants to balance code quality, unit test completeness, and UI/UX considerations while building ORM for database, creating multiple API endpoints with business logic plus an interactive dashboard with login functionality. Perhaps finding a way to streamline or break down the task into smaller components could help alleviate this difficulty.

Overall, the interview task is impressive and engaging, but considering the requirements, it might be worth extending the time allowed or reduce some complexities to make it more manageable for candidates.
